look for autoindex.conf and edit headername to be /index.php (or w/e the header file is).  / = webroot

restart httpd

also edit autoindex.conf  IndexOptions and make sure NameWidth=*  .. also maybe turn off FancyIndexing

create a symlink from header.php in /jmplayer to your webroot (/var/www/html/ probably)
